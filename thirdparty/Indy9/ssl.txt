SSL Issues

While we are not lawyers we are working on putting together a summary of the issues surrounding SSL. Please check back soon at http://www.nevrona.com/indy/ssl.html.

Encryption Exportation

The US and other countries have restrictions on export of SSL technology. Because we cannot assure where people would download our stuff from, we cannot distribute the SSL code itself. But there are no restrictions on import.  Because of this the SSL DLLs are available for download from another country.  Legal There may be legal issues with your use of SSL. RSA's main patent has expired and this certainly improves the situation.

No Inherent License

Indy allows you to do SSL by providing the code, but we do not provide a license to use SSL. If you use SSL, it is up to you to make sure that you are legally permitted to use it in the country you are in and for your application.

Download 

Because of export restrictions we do not provide them. But they are available at Intelicom in Slovenia. The URL is http://www.intelicom.si/english.html.

Installation

To develop with the SSL DLL's and deploy your SSL applications, we recommend that you place the DLL's in the  Windows\System directory.
